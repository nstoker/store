# README

Having another attempt at getting a docker system set up for developing the Rocktrack application I am thing about.

Currently following the [guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) getting started with dev container, then the Getting Started with Rails.

Following [docker docs use containerised databases](https://docs.docker.com/guides/databases/).

More news when I get some...
